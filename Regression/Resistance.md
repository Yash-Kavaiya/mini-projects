## Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

- Theory: Brief overview of Ohm's law and using linear regression to find resistance
- Procedure: Description of the experiment procedure to collect voltage and current readings
- Analysis: Loading and preprocessing data, fitting linear regression model, plotting data and model
- Error Analysis: Calculating error metrics like R-squared to evaluate model accuracy 
- Results: Resistance value and accuracy determined from linear regression model

## Requirements

The following Python packages need to be installed to run the notebook:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

The notebook can be run by executing the cells in order. The data is read from the provided `resistance_data.txt` file.

The linear regression model and analysis results can be modified by tweaking the code in the Analysis and Error Analysis sections.

## Conclusion

The notebook demonstrates an effective way to analyze experimental measurements and determine component values using linear regression. The results verify Ohm's law within the accuracy of the collected data.
